            The Golden Pass event is an exciting opportunity for players to
            boost their performance on the leaderboards and earn unique rewards.
            By doubling their rewards, players can climb higher in the rankings
            and earn exclusive prizes. This added incentive makes the event more
            engaging and encourages players to aim for the top spot on the
            leaderboards.
          </p>
          <p className="package-popup-desc">
            One of the main benefits of participating in the Golden Pass event
            is the chance to get extra rewards. This makes it an essential event
            for players who want to make the most of their time in the game and
            improve their gaming experience.
          </p>
          <p className="package-popup-desc">
            Another benefit of participating in the Golden Pass event is the
            competitive environment it creates. With double rewards on the line,
            players are encouraged to compete against others and improve their
            performance on the leaderboards. This adds a new level of excitement
            and challenge to the game, making it more engaging for players.
          </p>
          <span className="popup-secondary-title">How it works:</span>
          <ul className="package-popup-desc">
            <li className="package-popup-desc">
              To participate in the Golden Pass event, players need to purchase
              the bundle in Marketplace using DYP token on BNB Chain or Ethereum Chain.
            </li>
            <li className="package-popup-desc">
              The Golden Pass bundle is available for a month and can be
              purchased once a month.
            </li>
            <li className="package-popup-desc">
              If a player purchases the fourth bundle, they will receive the
              entire time left to participate in the event until the end of the
              month.
            </li>
            <li className="package-popup-desc">
              Once the bundle is active, players will receive extra rewards
              based on their leaderboard ranking.
            </li>
            <li className="package-popup-desc">
              It's important to note that the bundle must be active at the time
              of the leaderboard reset for players to receive the double
              rewards.
            </li>
          
            <li className="package-popup-desc">
              Players can earn unique rewards and prizes that can only be earned
              during the Golden Pass event.
